# CV Parameters
#
# Color mask describes the upper and lower bound for colors we are interested
# in in RGB space.  Change this if operating with alternative lane line colors.
#
# Horizon mask is a number from 0 to 1 describing how much of the top half of
# the picture to crop. (No lanes in the sky so we can just discard that
# information)
#
# Gaussian blur is the the size of the blurring filter to use (in pixels).
# This is used to help smooth irregularities in the raw image.
#
# Canny contains the two parameters passed to Canny edge detection: threshold 1
# and threshold 2
#
# Line detection are parameters fed into the Hough Transformer.  For details
# see the OpenCV documentation.
#
# Boundary is what left most and right most percentage of the image will be
# used to detect the lane boundary markers.

# Post Processing Parameters
#
# lpf size is the size of the moving average filter (low pass filter) used to
# reduce noise on the deviation angle detected by the lane follower
lpf size: 5

# Driving Parameters
#
# Velocity is the desired forward velocity.
# p is the amount of proportional control to be applied:
# i is the amount of integral control to be applied
# d is the amount of derivative control to be applied
# right_boost and left_boost are constant velocities added to their respective
#    wheels to componsate for poorly manufactured motors
velocity: 0.5
p: 0.2
i: 0.0
d: 0.1
left_boost: 0.0
right_boost: 0.0

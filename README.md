# Optimal Fixed Priority Scheduling in Multi-Stage Multi-Resource Distributed Real-Time Systems

- gen_test_case -> test case generation module
- scheduler -> all approaches, including baselines
- To generate test cases, rum makefile in gen_test_case
- To run schedulers, run makefile in scheduler
- Directories input, output, and test_case are expected
- input expects input_test file to set test case generation paramters, refer a sample
